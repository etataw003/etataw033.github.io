        <div class="subheading mb-5">Film and Digital ProductionðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Former Computer Science to current Film major and soon to be computer science double major. Concentration/ interest in graphics, rendering software as well as Animation. Studied both 3d and stop motion animation. Reels and short films in the portfolio are linked. References are also linked. Stop motion production techniques and skills were 100% self taught, learned autodidact. Technical skills in production gave a sounding board to jump off from and slowly gain knowledge in an animation style as well as others to grow skills. And ultimately create higher quality produced animated projects. Cinematography, Aesthetics are the background that is applied from my technical base.  Most of the projects I work on I think about how I can push  farther on what is possible visually from a software or technical perspective. Creatively, this skill set enables me to do more as an artist and aspiring filmmaker. While at the same time reinforcing the creative problem solving that is needed to uniquely create and innovate in both computer science and filmmaking industry and field respectively. In this retrospective I am lucky.<br><br>

        Overall, I have Minimal freelance experience in image generation and graphic design, 4 years experience in 3D and stop motion animation, and produced numerous projects. Specializing in Maya and Blender, with python, C++, MEL, GLSL scripting for shader. Also creating custom plugins for Maya Blender and After Effects. Plugin enables the creation of original effects and Culminating a strong technical and artistic background in film through my skills and experience. In addition to these skills Iâ€™ve built 3d characters assets  and environments for VR/AR in Unreal engine. Iâ€™ve used this software in cinema film based and game based capacity. Virtual experience creation skills naturally intersected with my other areas of interest so, it was a revelation to me to begin learning and creating things in this software. My main experience in film productions and animation comes from collaborative projects with colleagues and fellows students, in addition to independent produced shorts. But I believe my best work has exclusively come out from collaborative endeavors.<br><br>

        I have experience building armatures, rigs, and set up for stop motion productions and fully animation projects from start to finish. In both stop motion and 3d animation projects Iâ€™ve done this. Specializing in character animation and effects animation specifically. Mostly achieved through After Effects, Premier Pro, Photoshop software I have long term experience with.  Evidence by shorts reels here on the website. Showing Iâ€™ve been exposed to a variety of stop motion productions. In addition to my technical ability, through post production work.  As well as my work in VR/AR those skills often transferred over. Writing a shader then applying it to a character or environment. Knowing from an ideas inception to execution what is possible technically to make the creative process broader and more experimental, or at least I think of it as such. I always say itâ€™s like being bilingual in a production environment, I can understand what both sides want to achieve and help communicate with one another to make that possible. I believe that is the greatest strength of this skill.
